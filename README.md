Steganography is an cryptographic technique that is used to hide information withing a digital file such as image.
In this repositary, you could find the stego file containing the code for steganography.
Edit the code with the image you want to use for hiding the message.
Python language is used for coding.
we have imported some libraries { CV2, OS, STRING }.
stego py need cv2 lib.
Before executing the code, make sure you install the cv2 in the cmd using  " pip install cv2 "
Then you can see an encryptedimage is created that contains the message inside the image.
